## What is CanITrust.in?

Browsers nowadays have a lot of built-in security features to help make the web more safe by default. Although this is a great thing, unfortunately, different browsers implement these features slightly different than other browsers. And sometimes, the implementations also differ from browser version to browser version.

This is where [CanITrust.in](https://canitrust.in) comes to the rescue. Inspired by the great [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com), we built an environment to test all those different security features. This web site makes the results available.

## How can I contribute?

Please check out the corresponding [guide](https://github.com/canitrust/backend/wiki/How-to-contribute).

## Start the server

Its easiest with npm:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This should start the UI and automatically open your browser with http://localhost:3000. If not, you will have to start your browser manually.

To actually see data in the UI, please checkout the [API](https://github.com/canitrust/frontend-api) and start it in parallel.
